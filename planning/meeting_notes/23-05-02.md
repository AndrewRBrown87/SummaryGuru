# MongoDB and Prisma

Tangent: The opportunity to learn a new tech is one of the objectives of this project, so exploring new technologies and different stack options is time well spent.

MongoDB seems like a viable option. 

Pros:
- MERN stack devs
- New technology
Cons:
- May be overkill

Prisma also seems like a viable option. In fact, we should use Prisma. 

# JSSoup
- JSSoup library has very little documentation
- We can use axios or http libraries to extract HTML from a page
- We can parse it ourselves or find a library to parse it
- Then make the API call to OpenAI

# Information Flow

1. User enters URL
2. Make http get request to acquire the HTML of the URL
3. Parse the HTML
4. Display the title of the article (from the HTML) immediately AND make API call to OpenAI
5. Display the results from the API call 

# Takeaway Tasks

- Watch Alvin's lecture on Prisma
- Wireframe for the app
