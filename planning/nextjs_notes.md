# Async/Await 

- async functions are syntactic sugar for Promises
- good resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Kr9OSfDeU&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified

# NextJS Architecture 

- In Scheduler, the useEffect hook was used to fetch info from the server/API
- NextJS handles the server side requests and client side rendering all in one
- Routes are /pages/
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts
- Dynamic routes are handled here: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes
